<abstract>
<t>There are several problems that arise in the standard
Registrant/Registrar/Registry model when the operator of a zone is
neither the Registrant nor the Registrar for the delegation.  Historically
the issues have been minor, and limited to difficulty guiding the
Registrant through the initial changes to the NS records for the
delegation.  As this is usually a one-off activity when the operator first
takes charge of the zone it has not been treated as a serious issue.
</t>
<t>With the rise of DNSSEC it has become necessary for the Registrant in this
situation to make regular (often annual) changes to the delegation in
order to manage KSK rolls, by updating the delegation's DS record(s).
Under the current model this is prone to Registrant error and significant
delays.
</t>
<t>There is a need for a simple protocol which would allow a third party DNS
operator to update DS and NS records for a delegation without involving
the registrant in each operation.
</t>
<t>The protocol described in this draft is REST based, and when used through
an authenticated channel can be used to bootstrap DNSSEC.  Once DNSSEC is
established this channel can be used to trigger maintenance of delegation
records such as DS, NS, and glue records.   The protocol is kept simple
and flexible in order to accomodate different operating models.

<t>The commands can be:

<t>&quot;/getDS&quot;  install DS from CDS/CDNSKEY at domain present and different from current DS set
</t>
<t>&quot;/getNS&quot;  update NS set based on the childs NS set

<t>The basic answer is a jason blob the important parts of the blob are
</t>
<t>&quot;refer:&quot;  will contain an URI; this is an referal to an URI that is better able to do execute the command

<t>&quot;refused:&quot;  This command can not be executed, and the reason is inside the block
</t>
<t>&quot;debug:&quot;  list of debug messages normally empty unless debug flag is
present, this section should be ignored in normal processing

<t>&quot;error:&quot;  if there was one look inside debug for more details
</t>
<t>&quot;domain:&quot; what domain this is an answer for this section MUST be included in all answers
</t>
<t>&quot;rr:&quot;  the new list of rrs &quot;can be empty&quot;
</t>
<t>&quot;challenge:&quot; an RR to insert into the zone
</t>
<t>If ``refer'' block is present in answer then the client is instructed to
connect to that URI and retry the command there. Client SHOULD
always honor the refer command over all other answers it gets in
the answer.

<section anchor="authorization" title="Authorization">
<t>The authorization can be either based on Token (like auth code) or buy
challenge i.e. inserting a blob into the zone.  It is up to registrars
to register the referral URI with registries, or block the access to
updating DS and NS.
